		<p id="main-bio" ="main-bio">I like adventure and enjoy watching travel vlogs on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. When I was little my family and I didn't go on many large scale adventures. The furthest we really traveled was about 4 hours east to a little seaside town called Rockport, MA. My family and I would visit this place every summer. </p>

		<p id="content-bio">I feel that this place is where my sense of adventure came from. I would look out at the sailboats and wonder where they came from and where they would go next. I would gaze out to the ocean and dream about what sealife was lurking underneath the surface. We would usually stay at the Captain's Bounty Motor Inn situated right on Front Beach (Front Beach Pictured Above. Captain's Bounty would be off frame to the right). There is a statue of a pirate on the front side the of bounty. </p>

		<p>I remember when I was little we found a gold plated ear piece in the parking lot and my dad convinced my brothers and I it was from a pirate. My head swilled with epic sea adventures involving pirates and treasure and my imagination still has not changed.</p>
